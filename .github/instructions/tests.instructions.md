# Quoin â€¢ Testing Standards

- Framework: **Vitest** for unit tests, **Playwright** for e2e.  
- Follow **AAA** pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert).  
- Mock external services with **msw**; never hit real APIs in CI.  
- Name test suites after the unit under test; keep files alongside source with `.test.ts`.
